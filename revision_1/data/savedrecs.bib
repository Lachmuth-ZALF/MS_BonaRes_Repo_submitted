Title = {Companies preferences and willingness to pay for ecosystem services
   credits through an online-marketplace},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {69},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While greater business financing is important to halt the loss of
   biodiversity and environmental degradation, only a limited number of
   payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes receive voluntary
   financing from companies. Recently, pilot private ecosystem marketplaces
   have emerged to function as an intermediary between suppliers and
   private buyers for ecosystem services projects with varying levels of
   validation, verification, additionality and permanence. However,
   business interests have not yet been the topic of much empirical
   research. To answer our research question on the preferences of business
   sector towards the ecosystem services credits that support the provision
   of environmental public goods, we collected survey data from 618 German
   companies through an online survey in 2019. We analysed characteristics
   of companies, perceived opportunities and threats, types of ecosystem
   services credits and the willingness to spend as factors to understand
   companies' preferences. We showed that the ecosystem services credits
   concept appeals to a small proportion of companies. We found that
   companies have so far felt little pressure from assumed expectation. For
   example, there is no significant effect on companies' interest in nature
   conservation steering from the link between company and nature. A
   nationwide internet platform, along with scientifically-based
   predictions of project impacts, was particularly appreciated by
   companies as it facilitated easier engagement by revealing regional
   project opportunities. Climate protection, water quality, and
   biodiversity emerged as the most appealing ecosystem services categories
   for companies. Additionally, companies expressed a preference for
   bundling relevant ecosystem services options. Our study highlights the
   significance of considering companies' local preferences. Furthermore,
   we observed that the majority of companies demonstrated a willingness to
   make low threshold and flexible contributions. By presenting descriptive
   evidences based on primary data from a large number of companies, this
   research addresses a previously existing gap of business interests in
   financing ecosystem services provision via new innovative markets.},

Title = {Do rotations with cover crops increase yield and soil organic carbon?-A
   modeling study in southwest Germany},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {375},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Conservation agriculture practices of crop rotation with permanent soil
   cover have been widely promoted for improving long-term agroecosystem
   resilience in the face of changing climate. However, there has been no
   comprehensive evaluation of site-specific agroecosystem services of soil
   health and crop yield in response to improved crop rotations with and
   without cover crops (CCs) on field and spatial scales. We calibrated and
   applied a process-based agroecosystems model to determine the effects of
   improved crop rotation and cover cropping on soil organic N content and
   mineralization rate, soil organic carbon (SOC) change rate, soil CO2
   efflux, and crop yields. A 10-year cropping systems dataset from six
   sites in southwest Germany was used to calibrate and evaluate the DSSAT
   model and to provide the typical management practices of the
   conventional farming system in the region as the business-as-usual (BAU)
   scenario for model application. A 4-year crop rotation was then designed
   with and without the inclusion of commonly grown non-legume and legume
   CCs and applied in three cycles at the research sites and the
   surrounding region. Crop rotation without CCs treatments provided the
   no-CC scenario, therefore the effect of CC inclusion could be tested.
   Relative to BAU and no-CC, the inclusion of CCs in crop rotation on
   annual rate, resulted in 12\% and 3\% higher soil organic N and 6\% and
   8\% higher SOC change rate, respectively. Additional advantage of cover
   cropping on soil organic N and C was more pronounced by legume CCs while
   non-legume CCs were more efficient in reducing N leaching. Combined
   positive rotational and cover cropping effects were observed on winter
   wheat and oilseed rape yields at the research sites. However, we
   observed spatial variability of these results on regional scale,
   suggesting management by environment interactions that should be
   considered for site-specific management recommendations. Crop rotation
   with CCs significantly increased water productivity of cereal crops, but
   did not produce higher yield of winter and spring barley or silage maize
   compared with BAU unless only legume CCs were used in certain areas that
   are vulnerable to N losses. Our findings highlight the C sequestration
   potential of improved crop rotations and cover cropping emphasizing the
   need for site-specific management for agronomically improved and
   environmentally sound cropping systems.},

Title = {Challenges of Including Wet Grasslands with Variable Groundwater Tables
   in Large-Area Crop Production Simulations},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Large-scale assessments of agricultural productivity necessitate
   integrated simulations of cropland and grassland ecosystems within their
   spatiotemporal context. However, simultaneous simulations face
   limitations due to assumptions of uniform species distribution.
   Grasslands, particularly those with shallow groundwater tables, are
   highly sensitive to water availability, undergoing rapid species
   composition changes. We hypothesised that predicting above-ground
   biomass (AGB) remains challenging due to these dynamic responses. Ten
   years of data from four lysimeters at a German wet grassland site, with
   varying water table treatments, was utilised to test this hypothesis.
   Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive indirect effect of the
   water regime on AGB, with a one-year time lag (r = 0.97). The MONICA
   model initially exhibited fair agreement (d = 0.69) in simulating
   Leaf-Area-Index (LAI) but performed poorly in replicating AGB (d = 0.3).
   After removing the species composition change effect from the LAI and
   AGB datasets, the simulation notably improved, with the overall relative
   root mean square error (rRMSE) of AGB decreasing from 1.55 to 0.90
   between the first and second simulations. This demonstrates MONICA's
   ability to predict grass growth patterns amidst changing water supply
   levels for constant species composition. However, it needs a competition
   model to capture biomass growth changes with varying water supply.},

Title = {A millennium of arable land use - the long-term impact of tillage and
   water erosion on landscape-scale carbon dynamics},
Journal = {SOIL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {281-305},
Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {In the last decades, soils and their agricultural management have
   received great scientific and political attention due to their potential
   to act as a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Agricultural
   management has strong potential to accelerate soil redistribution, and,
   therefore, it is questioned if soil redistribution processes affect this
   potential CO 2 sink function. Most studies analysing the effect of soil
   redistribution upon soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics focus on water
   erosion and analyse only relatively small catchments and relatively
   short time spans of several years to decades. The aim of this study is
   to widen this perspective by including tillage erosion as another
   important driver of soil redistribution and by performing a model-based
   analysis in a 200 km 2 sized arable region of northeastern Germany for
   the period since the conversion from forest to arable land (approx. 1000
   years ago). The spatially explicit soil redistribution and carbon (C)
   turnover model SPEROS-C was applied to simulate lateral soil and SOC
   redistribution and SOC turnover. The model parameterisation uncertainty
   was estimated by simulating different realisations of the development of
   agricultural management over the past millennium. The results indicate
   that, in young moraine areas, which are relatively dry but have been
   intensively used for agriculture for centuries, SOC patterns and
   dynamics are substantially affected by tillage-induced soil
   redistribution processes. To understand the landscape-scale effect of
   these redistribution processes on SOC dynamics, it is essential to
   account for long-term changes following land conversion as typical
   soil-erosion-induced processes, e.g. dynamic replacement, only take
   place after former forest soils reach a new equilibrium following
   conversion. Overall, it was estimated that, after 1000 years of arable
   land use, SOC redistribution by tillage and water results in a
   current-day landscape-scale C sink of up to 0.66 parts per thousand yr -
   1 of the current SOC stocks.},

Title = {Improving winter wheat yield prediction by accounting for weather and
   model parameter uncertainty while assimilating LAI and updating weather
   data within a crop model},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Accurate crop yield predictions play a crucial role in enabling informed
   policy-making to ensure food security. Beyond using advanced methods
   such as remote sensing and data assimilation (DA), it is essential to
   comprehend the influence of various sources of uncertainty on the
   overall prediction uncertainty. This study presents a novel approach for
   enhancing the accuracy of crop yield predictions by assimilating
   remotely-sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) and updating weather ensemble data
   into a crop model (SPASS) while accounting for calibration and weather
   uncertainty. In addition, we investigated the effect of model
   calibration prior to DA by four calibration data type scenarios. These
   scenarios involve calibrating the crop model to different combinations
   of yield, phenology, and LAI, ranging from minimum (yield only) to
   maximum (yield, phenology, and LAI) data availability. To address
   weather uncertainty, we derived weather forecasts downscaled from
   climate models utilizing the MarkSim weather generator. Our results
   demonstrate that the assimilation LAI and updating weather data
   significantly reduces the overall uncertainty in crop yield predictions.
   Notably, the uncertainty associated with weather ensembles has a more
   substantial influence compared to the uncertainty resulting from
   calibration. This finding highlights the significance of accounting for
   variations and discrepancies in weather predictions when assessing yield
   uncertainty. Additionally, given the set of SPASS model parameters used
   for winter wheat calibration, additional field-based LAI data does not
   improve the calibration quality.},

Title = {Harvest residues: A relevant term in the carbon balance of croplands?},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {349},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Over the past two decades, major efforts have been made to quantify the
   extent to which and under what conditions croplands are sources or sinks
   for carbon. For this purpose, the net carbon stock change of the study
   site is typically quantified based on net CO 2 fluxes monitored with an
   eddy covariance or chamber system, on measured C import by organic
   fertilizer and C export by harvest. While in cropland studies this
   balance is usually referred to as net biome productivity (NBP), we
   prefer to use the term net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) here. NECB is
   basically the sum of the stock change of plant carbon ( Delta PC) and
   soil organic carbon ( Delta SOC). In the standard approach, the
   assumption is that at an annual cropland site the bulk of plant biomass
   is typically removed at harvest, and that Delta PC can therefore be
   neglected. In this case, Delta SOC equals NECB. In this paper we show
   that this assumption is problematic, particularly if in crop rotation
   systems the budget is determined over a single cropping period. The
   present contribution extends the concept of NECB to include harvest
   residues (HR) and applies it to a case study over a maize - winter wheat
   - winter wheat rotation at a cropland site in southwest Germany. In all
   three cropping periods, the sign of NECB was opposite that of Delta SOC.
   Accordingly, neglecting HR led to an incorrect result concerning the
   question whether the site is a sink or a source for soil carbon. Our
   findings demonstrate that for croplands HR must be included to obtain an
   accurate and meaningful carbon balance.},

Title = {Climate change causes spatial shifts in the productivity of agricultural
   long-term field experiments},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Long-term field experiments (LTE) are highly valuable infrastructures in
   agricultural- and soil sciences for understanding the long-term impacts
   of climate and management practices. While they are designed to run
   under constant conditions, climate change is expected to affect site
   conditions considerably. This needs to be quantified when interpreting
   experimental results and when redesigning the experimental setup. One
   way to achieve this is by utilizing vegetation growth and carbon
   dynamics, specifically the Net Primary Productivity (NPP), as a
   spatially explicit indicator. NPP facilitates the assessment and
   interpretation of yield performance in LTEs under future climatic
   conditions. Our study estimated the changes in NPP for 271 LTE sites in
   Germany, comparing a baseline (2000-2020) with two scenarios (2081-2100)
   that were based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (SSP245) and
   SSP585) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We used
   the NASACASA biogeochemical model to calculate NPP in baseline and IPCC
   scenarios using Germany as a test case. LTEs were grouped by land use
   (crop types) and soil information (soil type, texture), drawing on the
   geodata infrastructure ``BonaRes Repository{''}. The total annual
   terrestrial NPP for the baseline was calculated as 202.4 Mt C (sum of
   forests, grasslands, and arable lands) in Germany, while total NPP was
   up to 56.0 Mt C for different land use types. For both scenarios, NPP
   was projected to increase in LTEs located in southern Germany,
   indicating increased crop productivity, while a decrease was projected
   for the central Germany. The decrease in NPP of numerous LTEs in central
   Germany was estimated to extend to the LTEs in the eastern part
   corresponding to the worst -case scenario SSP585. Explicitly, the use of
   the multi -model ensemble mean as the climate driver in modelling may
   overestimate projected NPP by reducing inter -annual variability,
   highlighting the importance of methodological choices for accurate
   future projections. Besides, the results indicated that poor soils are
   projected to experience a further decline in productivity, primarily
   attributed to escalating water scarcity. Conversely, soils with high
   quality are likely to witness enhanced productivity, largely driven by
   the extension of the growing seasons. The outcomes of this study provide
   a basis for considering the future conditions of German LTEs and
   facilitate distinguishing between the effects of climate change and the
   impact of agricultural management on productivity at the regional level.
   These outputs enable planning and developing research strategies for
   selecting future LTE sites and redesigning existing or newly planned
   experiments. Moreover, the integrated modelling framework presented here
   highlights the potential of LTE data for large-scale modelling studies
   of ecosystem functions.},

Title = {Within-season crop yield prediction by a multi-model ensemble with
   integrated data assimilation},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {308},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Improving crop yield prediction accuracy is crucial for sustainable
   agriculture. One approach is to use data assimilation (DA) techniques
   based on satellite remote sensing, which can help improve predictions at
   the regional to national scale. However, the interaction between
   uncertain crop model inputs and DA, as well as the impact of crop model
   structure on DA results, have received little attention to date. In this
   work, we assimilated leaf area index (LAI) data into three single crop
   models (CERES, GECROS, and SPASS) as well as into their multimodel
   ensemble (MME) using a particle filtering (PF) algorithm. Mimicking the
   common lack of information at a large scale, we considered nitrogen
   fertilization, sowing date, soil hydraulic parameters, and weather data
   as the sources of uncertainties. In a case study, we applied this setup
   to six winter wheat site years in southwestern Germany. Before applying
   DA, all models were calibrated and validated using in-situ measured data
   from a multi-site, multi-year independent data set. The model
   performance in the calibration was used to assign weights to the models
   of the MME. Results show that weather data and soil hydraulic parameters
   had the highest impact on all model predictions. DA substantially
   improved the accuracy and precision of LAI simulation in all models.
   Moreover, DA enhanced grain yield prediction by GECROS, SPASS, and the
   multi-model ensemble, but had no considerable effect on CERES.
   Specifically, the bias in yield prediction decreased from 25\% to 15\%
   in the case of GECROS, from 26\% to 15\% in SPASS, and from 19\% to 7\%
   in the MME. In contrast, even without DA, the yield prediction error in
   CERES was below 5\%. The correlation between LAI errors and yield errors
   was a key factor indicating how DA can be effective on a specific model.
   When the correlation analysis is unavailable, the multimodel ensemble is
   a promising approach for data assimilation. Further investigations on
   regional model calibration, input uncertainty, MME size, and model
   weighting scheme are necessary to improve the performance of data
   assimilation applications.},

   and food sector. In this publication, we describe a dataset with
   crop-yield and area data for Germany from 1979 to 2021. The data are
   spatially resolved to 397 districts, which have an average size of 900
   km2, and include the crops spring barley, winter barley, grain maize,
   silage maize, oats, potatoes, winter rape, rye, sugarbeet, triticale and
   winter wheat. The crop-yield data cover, on average, about 9.5 million
   hectares per year and 80\% of Germany's total arable land. The dataset
   contains 214,820 yield and area data points. These were obtained by
   collecting and digitizing crop data from multiple statistical sources
   and transforming the data to match the district boundaries in 2020.
   Potential applications of the data include the analysis of interactions
   between agricultural yields and environmental factors, such as weather;
   the validation of yield prediction methodologies or the analysis of
   yield-loss risks in agriculture.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING},

Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The ambition of this study was to justify the possibility of wheat trait
   prediction using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a
   newly developed Plant-O-Meter sensor. Acquired data from Plant-O-Meter
   was matched with GreenSeeker's, which was designated as a reference. The
   experiment was carried out in the field during the 2022 growing season
   at the long-term experimental field. The experimental design included
   five different winter wheat genotypes and 20 different NPK fertilizer
   treatments. The GreenSeeker sensor always gave out NDVI values that were
   higher than those of the Plant-O-Meter by, on average, 0.029 (6.36\%).
   The Plant-O-Meter sensor recorded similar NDVI values (94\% of the
   variation is explained, P<0.01). The Plant-O-Meter's NDVIs had a higher
   CV for different wheat varieties and different sensing dates. For almost
   all varieties, GreenSeeker exceeded Plant-O-Meter in predicting yields
   for the early (March 21st) and late (June 6th) growing seasons.
   NDVIGreenSeeker data improved yield modeling performance by an average
   of 5.1\% when compared to NDVIPlant- O-Meter; in terms of plant height
   prediction, NDVIGreenSeeker was 3\% more accurate than NDVIPlant-
   O-Meter and no changes in spike length prediction were found. A compact,
   economical and user-friendly solution, the Plant-O-Meter, is
   straightforward to use in wheat breeding programs as well as mercantile
   wheat production.},

Abstract = {Mid-term (MTEs, 5-20 years) and long-term (LTEs, 20+ years) field
   experiments are key sources of information to design future
   climate-smart agriculture. Within the European Joint Program SOIL (EJP
   SOIL), we built the EJP SOIL-MTE/LTE metadataset that contains metadata
   from 240 MTEs/LTEs across Europe. Metadata collected included precise
   descriptions of the treatments (combination of factors such as tillage,
   crop type/rotation, amendments/fertilizers, grazing and pest/weed
   management), soil and crop measurements and pedo-climatic information.
   Using different figures and dashboards, an overview of those MTEs/LTEs
   is presented and specific research themes (tillage systems, residue
   management, amendment type and cover crops) are further analysed within
   their pedo-climatic context. An interactive web portal developed in
   collaboration with the BonaRes project (), enables users to explore the
   metadataset and find relevant MTEs/LTEs for specific combinations of
   practices (e.g. all MTEs/LTEs that investigate cover crops on a Cambisol
   in no-tillage system). Finally, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses,
   Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the metadataset was carried out to
   highlight the potential contribution of MTEs/LTEs to a harmonized
   European soil observation and monitoring approach. We propose that the
   metadataset could be elaborated with metadata from other existing
   MTEs/LTEs in Europe or even worldwide.},

Abstract = {Kettle holes are able to increase the soil and air humidity around them.
   Therefore, they create a perfect habitat for phytopathogenic fungi of
   the genera Fusarium and Alternaria to develop, sporulate, and immigrate
   into neighboring agricultural fields. In our study, we establish
   transects from the edges of different kettle holes and field edges up to
   50 m into the fields to analyze the abundance and diversity of
   pathogenic fungi in these transition zones by culture-dependent and
   culture-independent methods. However, in 2019 and 2020, low
   precipitation and higher temperatures compared to the long-time average
   were measured, which led to limited infections of weeds in the
   transition zones with Fusarium and Alternaria. Therefore, the
   hypothesized significantly higher infection of wheat plants next to the
   kettle holes by a strong spread of fungal spores was not detected.
   Infestation patterns of Fusarium and Alternaria fungi on weeds and wheat
   ears were spatially different. In total, 9 different Fusarium species
   were found in the transition zone. The species diversity at kettle holes
   differed from 0 to 6 species. The trend toward increased dryness in the
   northeast German agricultural landscape and its impact on the changing
   severity of fungal infections is discussed.},

Abstract = {Trees alter microclimate and radiation budget in alley cropping systems,
   which in turn change physiological processes of the grassland component.
   The influence of the trees on grassland growth depends on the climate
   zone as well as possibly on weather conditions during the respective
   growth interval. The proportion of shade-tolerant species in the
   grassland further modifies the tree effect on grassland growth, as well
   as the number of annual harvests. We studied the effect of distance and
   orientation relative to the tree line (tree line in the South-West vs.
   North-East) on growth rates of the adjacent grassland with two cutting
   frequencies (frequent vs. infrequent) in an alley cropping system with
   grassland of two different vegetation compositions (diverse vs.
   grass-clover) and willow clones. Microclimate parameters and radiation
   were measured at the points where growth rates were determined to better
   characterize the effect of position relative to the tree line. Growth
   rates differed significantly (p < 0.05) depending on the distance to the
   trees and annual biomass accumulation amounted to 389 +/- 13.5 g m(-2)
   in the center vs. 321 +/- 10.0 g m(-2) with trees in the North-East vs.
   292 +/- 9.2 g m(-2) with trees in the South-West of the transect
   position. Lower growth rates occurred at positions with lower light
   quantities close to the trees, namely the position with the trees
   adjacent in the South-West. Temperature and relative humidity
   differences between the distances were significantly (p < 0.05) affected
   by distance to the tree line, but differences in neither soil nor air
   temperatures between the distances affected growth rates. Vegetation
   composition mediates the influence of the trees: the difference between
   positions was more pronounced in the diverse vegetation composition with
   higher productivities in the center between the alleys, but also with
   higher overall sward productivity.},

Title = {Twenty percent of agricultural management effects on organic carbon
   stocks occur in subsoils - Results of ten long-term experiments},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {356},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Agricultural management can influence soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks
   and thus may contribute to carbon sequestration and climate change
   mitigation. The soil depth to which agricultural management practices
   affect SOC is uncertain. Soil depth may have an important bearing on
   soil carbon dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to
   capture fully changes in SOC stocks. This applies in particular to the
   evaluation of carbon farming measures, which are becoming increasingly
   important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the upper metre
   of mineral cropland soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in
   Germany to quantify depth-specific effects on SOC stocks of common
   agricultural management practices: mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a
   combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation,
   irrigation, a crop rotation with preceding crops (pre-crops), straw
   incorporation, application of farmyard manure (FYM), liming, and reduced
   tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction on SOC stocks were
   examined as a negative side effect of agricultural management. Results
   showed that 19 \& PLUSMN; 3 \% of total management effects on SOC stocks
   were found in the upper subsoil (30-50 cm) and 3 \& PLUSMN; 4 \% in the
   lower subsoil (50-100 cm), including all agricultural management
   practices with significant topsoil SOC effects, while 79 \& PLUSMN; 7 \%
   of management effects were in the topsoil (0-30 cm). Nitrogen and NPK
   fertilisation were the treatments that had the greatest effect on
   subsoil organic carbon (OC) stocks, followed by irrigation, FYM
   application and straw incorporation. Sampling down to a depth of 50 cm
   resulted in significantly higher SOC effects than when considering
   topsoil only. A crop rotation with pre-crops, liming, reduced tillage
   and soil compaction did not significantly affect SOC stocks at any depth
   increment. Since approximately 20 \% of the impact of agricultural
   management on SOC stocks occurs in the subsoil, we recommend soil
   monitoring programs and carbon farming schemes extend their standard
   soil sam-pling down to 50 cm depth to capture fully agricultural
   management effects on SOC.},

Title = {Potential of natural language processing for metadata extraction

Abstract = {Summarizing information from large bodies of scientific literature is
   anessential but work-intensive task. This is especially true in
   environmentalstudies where multiple factors (e.g., soil, climate,
   vegetation) cancontribute to the effects observed. Meta-analyses,
   studies thatquantitatively summarize findings of a large body of
   literature, rely onmanually curated databases built upon primary
   publications. However, giventhe increasing amount of literature, this
   manual work is likely to requiremore and more effort in the future.
   Natural language processing (NLP)facilitates this task, but it is not
   clear yet to which extent theextraction process is reliable or complete.
   In this work, we explore threeNLP techniques that can help support this
   task: topic modeling, tailoredregular expressions and the shortest
   dependency path method. We apply thesetechniques in a practical and
   reproducible workflow on two corpora ofdocuments: the Open
   Tension-diskInfiltrometer Meta-database (OTIM) and the Meta corpus. The
   OTIM corpus contains the sourcepublications of the entries of the OTIM
   database of near-saturated hydraulicconductivity from tension-disk
   infiltrometer measurements(https://github.com/climasoma/otim-db, last
   access: 1 March 2023). The Meta corpus is constituted ofall primary
   studies from 36 selected meta-analyses on the impact ofagricultural
   practices on sustainable water management in Europe. As a firststep of
   our practical workflow, we identified different topics from
   theindividual source publications of the Meta corpus using topic
   modeling.This enabled us to distinguish well-researched topics (e.g.,
   conventionaltillage, cover crops), where meta-analysis would be useful,
   from neglectedtopics (e.g., effect of irrigation on soil properties),
   showing potentialknowledge gaps. Then, we used tailored regular
   expressions to extractcoordinates, soil texture, soil type, rainfall,
   disk diameter and tensionsfrom the OTIM corpus to build a quantitative
   database. We were able toretrieve the respective information with 56 \%
   up to 100 \% of allrelevant information (recall) and with a precision
   between 83 \% and100 \%. Finally, we extracted relationships between a
   set of driverscorresponding to different soil management practices or
   amendments (e.g.,{''}biochar{''}, ``zero tillage{''}) and target
   variables (e.g., ``soilaggregate{''}, ``hydraulic conductivity{''},
   ``crop yield{''}) from thesource publications' abstracts of the Meta
   corpus using the shortestdependency path between them. These
   relationships were further classifiedaccording to positive, negative or
   absent correlations between the driverand the target variable. This
   quickly provided an overview of the differentdriver-variable
   relationships and their abundance for an entire body ofliterature.
   Overall, we found that all three tested NLP techniques were ableto
   support evidence synthesis tasks. While human supervision
   remainsessential, NLP methods have the potential to support automated
   evidencesynthesis which can be continuously updated as new publications
   becomeavailable.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS EARTH \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Intensively managed open croplands are highly productive but often have
   deleterious environmental impacts. Temperate agroforestry potentially
   improves ecosystem functions, although comprehensive analysis is
   lacking. Here, we measured primary data on 47 indicators of seven
   ecosystem functions in croplands and 16 indicators of four ecosystem
   functions in grasslands to assess how alley-cropping agroforestry
   performs compared to open cropland and grassland. Carbon sequestration,
   habitat for soil biological activity, and wind erosion resistance
   improved for cropland agroforestry (P <= 0.03) whereas only carbon
   sequestration improved for grassland agroforestry (P < 0.01). In
   cropland agroforestry, soil nutrient cycling, soil greenhouse gas
   abatement, and water regulation did not improve, due to customary high
   fertilization rates. Alley-cropping agroforestry increased
   multifunctionality, compared to open croplands. To ameliorate the
   environmental benefits of agroforestry, more efficient use of nutrients
   is required. Financial incentives should focus on conversion of open
   croplands to alley-cropping agroforestry and incorporate fertilizer
   management.
   Alley-cropping agroforestry enhances carbon sequestration compared to
   open cropland and open grassland, and improves soil biological habitat
   and erosion resistance relative to open cropland, based on measured
   ecosystem functions at five sites in Germany.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {345},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Global farmland biodiversity has declined rapidly in recent decades due
   to the homogenization of agricultural landscapes, including an increase
   in field sizes and decrease in woody features, such as hedgerows.
   Restructuring landscapes by (re)introducing woody features and
   decreasing field sizes can support biodiversity but at the cost of lower
   returns in farming. Striking a balance between biodiversity and
   agricultural net returns is increasingly pertinent. Here, we use spatial
   multi-objective optimization to allocate woody features and adapt
   average field sizes at the landscape scale to assess the trade-off
   between biodiversity, measured as the occurrence of farmland birds, and
   potential net returns from crop production. Our results suggest that,
   compared to the current land-scape configuration, both agricultural net
   returns and biodiversity can be simultaneously increased. Restruc-turing
   only 5\% of the landscape can improve bird abundance by 2\% and generate
   about euro2 million in agricultural net returns. We show that increases
   in farmland bird diversity are highly dependent on the location and on
   farmers' willingness to accept negative impacts on agricultural net
   returns. Our spatially explicit approach supports spatially targeted
   land use planning that can strike a better balance between the economic
   objectives of farmers and the societal desire to conserve biodiversity.},

Title = {Climate change impacts on long-term field experiments in Germany},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {205},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: Long-Term Field Experiments (LTEs) were implemented to study
   the long-term effects of different management practices, including
   tillage, fertilization and crop rotation under otherwise constant
   conditions. Climate change is expected to change these conditions,
   challenging interpretation of LTE data with regard to the distinction
   between climate change and management effects.OBJECTIVE: The objective
   of the study was to quantify the expected, spatially differentiated
   changes of agro-climatic conditions for the German LTE sites as a
   precondition for modelling and LTE data interpretation.METHODS: We
   developed a framework combining spatially distributed climate data and
   LTE metadata to identify the possible climatic changes at 247 LTE sites
   with experiments running for 20 years or more. The LTEs were classified
   using the following categories: fertilization, tillage, crop rotation,
   field crops or grassland, con-ventional or organic. We utilized climate
   variables (temperature, precipitation) and agroclimatic indicators
   (aridity, growing degree days, etc.) to compare a baseline (1971-2000)
   with future periods (2021-2100) under the IPCC's Shared Socio-economic
   Pathways (SSP). A comprehensive LTE risk assessment was conducted, based
   on changes in climate variables and agroclimatic indicators between
   baseline and future scenarios.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under the most
   extreme scenario (SSP585), 150 LTEs are expected to shift from humid and
   dry sub-humid to semi-arid conditions. Frost days in LTE areas are
   expected to decline by 81\%, and the growing season to lengthen by up to
   92\%. The spatial differentiation of expected climate change also
   fa-cilitates the identification of suitable sites for future
   agricultural practices and may inform the design of new
   LTEs.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results may guide the interpretation of LTE data
   regarding the effect of climate change, facilitating future soil crop
   modelling studies with LTE data and providing information for planning
   new LTE sites to support future agricultural research and/or adapting
   management on existing LTE sites. The framework we developed can easily
   be transferred to LTE sites in agricultural regions worldwide to support
   LTE research on climate change impacts and adaptation.},

Abstract = {Temporal changes in the bird community of an agricultural landscape in
   northeast Germany were analysed covering three different analytical foci
   (landscape-wide, habitat types, sample plots) and two aggregation levels
   of bird observation data (whole bird community, bird guilds). The
   analyses are based on a systematic data sampling over two multi-year
   campaigns (1999-2002; 2013-2015). Our analyses address the question of
   how changes in the occurrences of agricultural birds (numbers of species
   and of individuals) at local spots manifest themselves in the landscape
   as a whole. By summarizing all findings concerning single variables
   (number of species, observation frequencies, abundances, different
   habitat types, bird guilds), a dramatic, systematic decline of the bird
   community at sample plots was discovered between the campaigns, which is
   not yet recognisable across the whole landscape in terms of species
   richness. Furthermore, we found that landscape-wide, the birds' use of
   habitat changed; the variability between single sample plots increased
   strongly and most species occurred at fewer sample plots over the whole
   landscape. Obviously, sample plots with high bird occurrences are
   becoming more relevant for maintaining bird communities over the whole
   landscape. Bird community composition changed significantly within the
   observation period.},

Title = {Comparing participatory mapping and a spatial biophysical assessment of
   ecosystem service cold spots in agricultural landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, we assess the supply of five ecosystem services (ES, i.e.
   biodiversity provision, carbon sequestration, erosion control, water
   availability and yield) in an agricultural landscape in Northeast
   Germany as perceived by different stakeholders with a web-based
   questionnaire. We complement this participatory approach with a
   biophysical assessment of the same ES in the same study area using
   spatially explicit, indicator-based methods. A research gap exists in
   the combination of participatory and biophysical ES assessment methods
   within one study area. We derive spots of low supply of multiple ES
   (cold spots of ES supply) from the areas identified by the mapping and
   the biophysical assessment, and in collaboration with stakeholders of
   the region during an online workshop. Our interest is to (i) identify
   the advantages of comparing and combining biophysical with
   partici-patory methods to assess ES and to (ii) identify interfaces
   where combining both approaches can help to integrate ES assessment in
   landscape planning, management and design. Our goal is to establish an
   assessment basis that allows for a spatially explicit representation of
   trade-offs and synergies of ES by displaying multiple ES in one case
   study area, capable of integrating different resolutions. By comparing
   participatory and biophysical as-sessments, we identify ecological and
   social benefits of the landscape, and emphasize the social-ecological
   interface by limiting the scope of the biophysical assessment to the
   area of interest by the stakeholders. Be-sides, areas in which
   participants over-or underestimate the current ES supply are spotted by
   quantifying the gap between actual and perceived supply. The results
   reveal several similarities in the observations derived from both
   assessments. However, water availability is widely underestimated,
   whereas biodiversity and carbon seques-tration are slightly
   overestimated. Based on our results, we conclude that in many cases,
   stakeholders who are familiar with the landscape because they live there
   or have a professional relation to it have a profound un-derstanding of
   the ongoing ecosystem processes. The decision whether to use
   participatory, biophysical or both assessment techniques should be made
   according to the use case: from a governance perspective, participatory
   data can be easier to communicate and more easily accessible. We
   encourage the perspective that there are cases in which the
   low-threshold participatory data provide sufficiently reliable
   information to make informed de-cisions on ES management, particularly
   when biophysical assessment studies are too resource-and cost-intensive.},

Title = {A Bayesian sequential updating approach to predict phenology of silage
   maize},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},

Pages = {2187-2209},

Abstract = {Crop models are tools used for predicting year-to-year crop development
   on field to regional scales. However, robust predictions are hampered by
   uncertainty in crop model parameters and in the data used for
   calibration. Bayesian calibration allows for the estimation of model
   parameters and quantification of uncertainties, with the consideration
   of prior information. In this study, we used a Bayesian sequential
   updating (BSU) approach to progressively incorporate additional data at
   a yearly time-step in order to calibrate a phenology model (SPASS) while
   analysing changes in parameter uncertainty and prediction quality. We
   used field measurements of silage maize grown between 2010 and 2016 in
   the regions of Kraichgau and the Swabian A1b in southwestern Germany.
   Parameter uncertainty and model prediction errors were expected to
   progressively be reduced to a final, irreducible value. Parameter
   uncertainty was reduced as expected with the sequential updates. For two
   sequences using synthetic data, one in which the model was able to
   accurately simulate the observations, and the other in which a single
   cultivar was grown under the same environmental conditions, prediction
   error was mostly reduced. However, in the true sequences that followed
   the actual chronological order of cultivation by the farmers in the two
   regions, prediction error increased when the calibration data were not
   representative of the validation data. This could be explained by
   differences in ripening group and temperature conditions during
   vegetative growth. With implications for manual and automatic data
   streams and model updating, our study highlights that the success of
   Bayesian methods for predictions depends on a comprehensive
   understanding of the inherent structure in the observation data and of
   the model limitations.},

Abstract = {Biodiversity in urban ecosystems has the potential to increase ecosystem
   functions and support a suite of services valued by society, including
   services provided by soils. Specifically, the sequestration of carbon in
   soils has often been advocated as a solution to mitigate the steady
   increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere as a key driver of
   climate change. However, urban ecosystems are also characterized by an
   often high level of ecological novelty due to profound human-mediated
   changes, such as the presence of high numbers of non-native species,
   impervious surfaces or other disturbances. Yet it is poorly understood
   whether and how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning and services
   of urban soils under these novel conditions. In this study, we assessed
   the influence of above- and below-ground diversity, as well as
   urbanization and plant invasions, on multifunctionality and organic
   carbon stocks of soils in non-manipulated grasslands along an
   urbanization gradient in Berlin, Germany. We focused on plant diversity
   (measured as species richness and functional trait diversity) and, in
   addition, on soil organism diversity as a potential mediator for the
   relationship of plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our
   results showed positive effects of plant diversity on soil
   multifunctionality and soil organic carbon stocks along the entire
   gradient. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity
   enhanced soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon by increasing
   the diversity of below-ground organisms. These positive effects of plant
   diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil fauna were not restricted
   to native plant species only, but were also exerted by non-native
   species, although to a lesser degree. Synthesis. We conclude that
   enhancing diversity in plants and soil fauna of urban grasslands can
   increase the multifunctionality of urban soils and also add to their
   often underestimated but very valuable role in mitigating effects of
   climate change.},

Title = {Combining Crop Modeling with Remote Sensing Data Using a Particle
   Filtering Technique to Produce Real-Time Forecasts of Winter Wheat
   Yields under Uncertain Boundary Conditions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Within-season crop yield forecasting at national and regional levels is
   crucial to ensure food security. Yet, forecasting is a challenge because
   of incomplete knowledge about the heterogeneity of factors determining
   crop growth, above all management and cultivars. This motivates us to
   propose a method for early forecasting of winter wheat yields in
   low-information systems regarding crop management and cultivars, and
   uncertain weather condition. The study was performed in two contrasting
   regions in southwest Germany, Kraichgau and Swabian Jura. We used
   in-season green leaf area index (LAI) as a proxy for end-of-season grain
   yield. We applied PILOTE, a simple and computationally inexpensive
   semi-empirical radiative transfer model to produce yield forecasts and
   assimilated LAI data measured in-situ and sensed by satellites (Landsat
   and Sentinel-2). To assimilate the LAI data into the PILOTE model, we
   used the particle filtering method. Both weather and sowing data were
   treated as random variables, acknowledging principal sources of
   uncertainties to yield forecasting. As such, we used the stochastic
   weather generator MarkSim(R) GCM to produce an ensemble of uncertain
   meteorological boundary conditions until the end of the season. Sowing
   dates were assumed normally distributed. To evaluate the performance of
   the data assimilation scheme, we set up the PILOTE model without data
   assimilation, treating weather data and sowing dates as random variables
   (baseline Monte Carlo simulation). Data assimilation increased the
   accuracy and precision of LAI simulation. Increasing the number of
   assimilation times decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of LAI
   prediction from satellite data by similar to 1 to 0.2 m(2)/m(2). Yield
   prediction was improved by data assimilation as compared to the baseline
   Monte Carlo simulation in both regions. Yield prediction by assimilating
   satellite-derived LAI showed similar statistics as assimilating the LAI
   data measured in-situ. The error in yield prediction by assimilating
   satellite-derived LAI was 7\% in Kraichgau and 4\% in Swabian Jura,
   whereas the yield prediction error by Monte Carlo simulation was 10
   percent in both regions. Overall, we conclude that assimilating even
   noisy LAI data before anthesis substantially improves forecasting of
   winter wheat grain yield by reducing prediction errors caused by
   uncertainties in weather data, incomplete knowledge about management,
   and model calibration uncertainty.},

Title = {Linking a compartment model for West Nile virus with a flight simulator
   for vector mosquitoes},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {464},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Compartmental SIR and SEIR models have become the state of the art tools
   to study infection cycles of arthropod-borne viruses such as West Nile
   virus in specific areas. In 2018, the virus was detected for the first
   time in Germany, and incidents have been reported in humans, birds, and
   horses.
   The aim of the work presented here was to provide a tool for estimating
   West Nile virus infection scenarios, local hotspots and dispersal routes
   following its introduction into new locations through the movements of
   mosquitoes. For this purpose, we adapted a SEIR model for West Nile
   virus to the conditions in Germany (temperatures, geographical latitude,
   bird and mosquito species densities) and the characteristic transmission
   and life trait parameter of a possible host bird and vector mosquito
   species. We further extended it by a spatial component: an agent-based
   flight simulator for vector mosquitoes. It demonstrates how the female
   mosquitoes move within the landscape due to habitat structures and wind
   conditions and about how many of them leave the region in the different
   cardinal directions.
   We applied the space-time coupled model with a daily temporal and
   spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m to the Eurasian magpie (Pica pica)
   and the Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus). Both species
   are widely distributed in Germany and discussed as important hosts and
   vectors, respectively. We also applied the model to three study regions
   in Germany, each representing slightly different climatic conditions and
   containing significantly different pattern of suitable habitats for the
   mosquito species.},

Title = {Agro-economic prospects for expanding soybean production beyond its
   current northerly limit in Europe},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {133},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Soybean is one of the five crops that dominate global agriculture, along
   with maize, wheat, cotton and rice. In Europe, soybean still plays a
   minor role and is cultivated mainly in the South and East. Very little
   is known about the potential for soybean in higher latitudes with
   relatively cool conditions. To investigate the agronomic potential and
   limitations of soybean for feed (high grain yield) and food (high
   protein content, e.g., for tofu production) in higher latitudes, an
   organic soybean cropping system experiment was carried out from 2015 to
   2017 in northeastern Germany. The objectives were: (1) to identify food-
   and feed-grade soybean cultivars that are adapted to a central European
   climate in terms of protein, grain yield, and yield stability, (2) to
   explore the effect of irrigation on soybean protein and grain yield
   under relatively dry growing conditions, and (3) to determine the
   agro-economic potential of soybean cultivation for both feed and food
   markets. Three soybean cultivars were tested with and without
   irrigation. The soybean feed-grade cultivars `Sultana' and `Merlin' were
   better adapted to the growing cycle and temperature, providing higher
   and more stable yields (average 2700 kg ha(-1)) than the food-grade
   cultivar `Protibus' (average 1300 kg ha(-1)). Irrigation increased
   soybean grain yields by 41\% on average. In the year with sufficient
   precipitation, no additional irrigation was necessary. Gross margins of
   organic soybean ranged between 750 (sic) ha(-1) for the rainfed
   food-grade soybean and 2000 (sic) ha(-1) for the irrigated feed-grade
   soybean and were higher than other crops. We demonstrated a large
   agro-economic potential for soybean as a novel grain legume crop to
   diversify cropping systems and increase the production of protein crops
   in central Europe.},

Title = {Methodology to assess the changing risk of yield failure due to heat and
   drought stress under climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {While the understanding of average impacts of climate change on crop
   yields is improving, few assessments have quantified expected impacts on
   yield distributions and the risk of yield failures. Here we present the
   relative distribution as a method to assess how the risk of yield
   failure due to heat and drought stress (measured in terms of return
   period between yields falling 15\% below previous five year Olympic
   average yield) responds to changes of the underlying yield distributions
   under climate change. Relative distributions are used to capture
   differences in the entire yield distribution between baseline and
   climate change scenarios, and to further decompose them into changes in
   the location and shape of the distribution. The methodology is applied
   here for the case of rainfed wheat and grain maize across Europe using
   an ensemble of crop models under three climate change scenarios with
   simulations conducted at 25 km resolution. Under climate change, maize
   generally displayed shorter return periods of yield failures (with
   changes under RCP 4.5 between -0.3 and 0 years compared to the baseline
   scenario) associated with a shift of the yield distribution towards
   lower values and changes in shape of the distribution that further
   reduced the frequency of high yields. This response was prominent in the
   areas characterized in the baseline scenario by high yields and
   relatively long return periods of failure. Conversely, for wheat, yield
   failures were projected to become less frequent under future scenarios
   (with changes in the return period of -0.1 to +0.4 years under RCP 4.5)
   and were associated with a shift of the distribution towards higher
   values and a change in shape increasing the frequency of extreme yields
   at both ends. Our study offers an approach to quantify the changes in
   yield distributions that drive crop yield failures. Actual risk
   assessments additionally require models that capture the variety of
   drivers determining crop yield variability and scenario climate input
   data that samples the range of probable climate variation.},

Title = {Sustainable intensification of crop production under alternative future
   changes in climate and technology: The case of the North Savo region},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: Sustainable intensification (SI) is needed to cope with the
   challenges agriculture faces with respect to climate change and
   increasing food demand. Northern cropping systems may benefit from
   longer and warmer growing seasons, but the sustainability of production
   will be challenged due to increased production risks. Concentrated
   efforts are needed to find ways to adapt cropping to changing conditions
   and sustainably intensify production.
   OBJECTIVE: This study combined stakeholder knowledge and simulation
   modelling to find means for the sustainable intensification of cereal
   production in the North Savo region in Finland.
   METHODS: Stakeholders identified promising intensification measures in
   two workshops. Alternative options for sustainable intensification and
   climate adaptations and their combinations were assessed using the APSIM
   cropping system model. The model was used to assess cereal yields, the
   grain nitrogen (N) content, nitrate leaching and water productivity for
   a historical baseline (1981?2010) and mid-century conditions (2041?2070)
   projected by five general circulation models for different emission
   scenarios. Simulated management options included improved cultivars with
   later maturing characteristics, improved heat/drought resistance and
   nitrogenuse efficiency, increased N fertilisation levels, improved crop
   rotations together with improved soil, as well as supplementary and full
   irrigation.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results indicated that although
   a warming climate in conjunction with elevated atmospheric CO2
   concentrations generally increase yield levels, N uptake and water
   productivity, risks associated with higher N leaching due to increased
   precipitation are a challenge for the sustainability of crop production.
   Overall, different SI options affected the sustainability indicators
   studied more than future projected climate, strongly suggesting that
   there is a large potential for sustainably intensifying crop production
   in northern conditions, particularly when applying more than one
   intensification measure at a time. Among a wide set of SI options tested
   for their sustainability impacts, improved crop cultivars showed the
   firmest positive impacts. This was supported by the views of
   agricultural stakeholders in the region.
   SIGNIFICANCE: While the agricultural stakeholder?s suggestions for
   alternative SI options challenged the simulation approach to some
   extent, the simulations provided robust information for comparing the
   sustainability impacts of alternative measures.},

Title = {Dynamic of Dominant Plant Communities in Kettle Holes (Northeast
   Germany) during a Five-Year Period of Extreme Weather Conditions},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the ecosystem functions and services of central European
   kettle holes (small wetlands) requires knowledge about their
   spatiotemporal dynamics. A lot of existing research has been conducted
   on the wet-dry cycles of North American potholes, but much less is known
   about kettle holes. Based on the extreme weather conditions between 2015
   and 2020, we aimed to quantify differences among dominant plant
   communities of kettle holes using unmanned aerial systems. Different
   dominant plant communities were differently affected by dry and wet
   intervals with a major increase in terrestrial plants. Multivariate
   analysis showed strong variability in plant community composition for
   permanent and semi-permanent kettle holes, where hydrophytes decreased
   and nitrophilous perennials increased. Although we cannot provide
   quantitative results in succession over a five-year observation period,
   we found indications of progressive succession towards irreversible
   alternative stable states with woody plants for some kettle holes,
   especially of the ``storage type{''}. Therefore, we assume stronger
   changes in proportion of wetland types in kettle holes compared to
   potholes and we expect the proportion of wood-dominated kettle holes to
   increase in the central European landscape in the future, leading to
   enhanced homogenization of the landscape accompanied by a loss of
   ecosystem functions and services.},

Title = {Tree rows in temperate agroforestry croplands alter the composition of
   soil bacterial communities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background
   Tree-based intercropping (agroforestry) has been advocated to reduce
   adverse environmental impacts of conventional arable cropping. Modern
   agroforestry systems in the temperate zone are alley-cropping systems
   that combine rows of fast-growing trees with rows of arable crops. Soil
   microbial communities in these systems have been investigated
   intensively; however, molecular studies with high taxonomical resolution
   are scarce.
   Methods
   Here, we assessed the effect of temperate agroforestry on the abundance,
   diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities at three paired
   poplar-based alley cropping and conventional monoculture cropland
   systems using real-time PCR and Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S
   rRNA genes. Two of the three systems grew summer barley (Hordeum
   vulgare); one system grew maize (Zea mays) in the sampling year. To
   capture the spatial heterogeneity induced by the tree rows, soil samples
   in the agroforestry systems were collected along transects spanning from
   the centre of the tree rows to the centre of the agroforestry crop rows.
   Results
   Tree rows of temperate agroforestry systems increased the abundance of
   soil bacteria while their alpha diversity remained largely unaffected.
   The composition of the bacterial communities in tree rows differed from
   those in arable land (crop rows of the agroforestry systems and
   conventional monoculture croplands). Several bacterial groups in soil
   showed strong association with either tree rows or arable land,
   revealing that the introduction of trees into arable land through
   agroforestry is accompanied by the introduction of a tree row-associated
   microbiome.
   Conclusion
   The presence of tree row-associated bacteria in agroforestry increases
   the overall microbial diversity of the system. We speculate that the
   increase in biodiversity is accompanied by functional diversification.
   Differences in plant-derived nutrients (root exudates and tree litter)
   and management practices (fertilization and tillage) likely account for
   the differences between bacterial communities of tree rows and arable
   land in agroforestry systems.},

Title = {The role of phenology in the climate change impacts and adaptation
   strategies for tree crops: a case study on almond orchards in Southern
   Europe},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {294},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The assessment of the impact of climate change on Mediterranean crop
   systems is affected by a large number of uncertainties. To overcome this
   issue in an impact and adaptation assessment for tree crops, an
   experimental dataset containing 556 phenological observations was used
   to calibrate and validate a modelling framework based on the Dynamic
   Model and ASYMCUR approach, for assessing the flowering date of common
   Mediterranean almond cultivars. Data were collected over 12 years for 15
   almond cultivars in 5 locations in Andalusia (Southern Spain), covering
   a wide range of weather conditions. The model performance was good: for
   late-flowering cultivars Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 3.6 days and
   Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) was 0.89, while for
   early-flowering cultivars RMSE was 3.4 days and NSE was 0.83.
   Weather projections from an ensemble of 12 climate model outputs
   including 3 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used with
   the modelling framework for each almond cultivar to quantify the changes
   in flowering date and the associated weather conditions during this
   stage, under the future weather conditions of the Iberian Peninsula
   (IP). Thus, in future scenarios, depending on location, start of full
   bloom was delayed (in mild-winter areas) or advanced (in cold-winter
   areas), with the change in weather conditions during critical
   phenological stages potentially affecting the yield in different ways,
   depicting a high spatial variability in the projections within the IP.
   For this reason, a spatial analysis was applied to demarcate those areas
   with adverse weather conditions related to flowering stage.
   In light of our results it is concluded that the identification of
   impacts and adaptation strategies for Mediterranean agriculture requires
   a careful prior evaluation of the systems at local scale, due to the
   marked spatial heterogeneity and the remaining high uncertainties
   associated with the crop modelling.},

Title = {Statistical Analysis versus the M5P Machine Learning Algorithm to
   Analyze the Yield of Winter Wheat in a Long-Term Fertilizer Experiment},

Abstract = {To compare how different analytical methods explain crop yields from a
   long-term field experiment (LTFE), we analyzed the grain yield of winter
   wheat (WW) under different fertilizer applications in Muncheberg,
   Germany. An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model
   (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain
   yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and
   environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80\% of the
   variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application
   was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods.
   Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF
   application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of
   environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were
   quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model
   identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the
   main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation.
   Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of
   freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the
   total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both
   models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models,
   the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative
   number of days in July with temperatures above 30 degrees C, while the
   M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the
   grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting
   the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to
   the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors.
   However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model
   presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their
   critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured
   by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the
   statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model
   should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple
   variables.},

Abstract = {In the past few years, the interest in growing crops and trees for
   bioenergy production has increased. One agricultural practice is the
   mixed cultivation of fast-growing trees and annual crops or perennial
   grasslands on the same piece of land, which is referred to as one type
   of agroforestry (AF). The inclusion of tree strips into the agricultural
   landscape has been shown - on the one hand - to lead to reduced wind
   speeds and higher carbon sequestration above ground and in the soil. On
   the other hand, concerns have been raised about increased water losses
   to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we hypothesise
   that short rotation coppice agroforestry systems have higher water
   losses to the atmosphere via ET compared to monoculture (MC) agriculture
   without trees. In order to test the hypothesis, the main objective was
   to measure the actual evapotranspiration of five AF systems in Germany
   and compare those to five monoculture systems in the close vicinity of
   the AF systems.
   We measured actual ET at five AF sites in direct comparison to five
   monoculture sites in northern Germany in 2016 and 2017. We used an eddy
   covariance energy balance (ECEB) set-up and a low-cost eddy covariance
   (EC-LC) setup to measure actual ET over each AF and each MC system. We
   conducted direct eddy covariance (EC) measurement campaigns with
   approximately 4 weeks' duration for method validation.
   Results from the short-term measurement campaigns showed a high
   agreement between ETEC-LC and ETEC, indicated by slopes of a linear
   regression analysis between 0.86 and 1.3 (R-2 between 0.7 and 0.94)
   across sites. Root mean square errors of LEEC-LC vs. LEEC (where LE is
   the latent heat flux) were half as small as LEECEB vs. LEEC, indicating
   a superior agreement of the EC-LC set-up with the EC set-up compared to
   the ECEB set-up.
   With respect to the annual sums of ET over AF and MC, we observed small
   differences between the two land uses. We interpret this as being an
   effect of compensating the small-scale differences in ET next to and in
   between the tree strips for ET measurements on the system scale. Most
   likely, the differences in ET rates next to and in between the tree
   strips are of the same order of magnitude, but of the opposite sign, and
   compensate each other throughout the year. Differences between annual
   sums of ET from the two methods were of the same order of magnitude as
   differences between the two land uses. Compared to the effect of land
   use and different methods on ET, we found larger mean evapotranspiration
   indices (Sigma ET = Sigma P) across sites for a drier than normal year
   (2016) compared to a wet year (2017). This indicates that we were able
   to detect differences in ET due to different ambient conditions with the
   applied methods, rather than the potentially small effect of AF on ET.
   We conclude that agroforestry has not resulted in an increased water
   loss to the atmosphere, indicating that agroforestry in Germany can be a
   land-use alternative to monoculture agriculture without trees.},

Abstract = {To halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, various actors

   from 618 German companies, collected through an online-survey in 2019.
   We show that a favourable attitude, driven by perceived business
   relevance and benefit prospects, fosters engagement. Perceived
   difficulties, such as lacking finances and knowledge, hinder the
   engagement. Customers, employees and the general public are presently
   the only stakeholder groups that drive corporate conservation
   engagement. Nevertheless, the expectation levels of virtually all
   stakeholders were found to be quite low and as such inadequate for the
   ecological crisis we face. We discuss how political will and goal
   setting can encourage more widespread business support for the natural

Abstract = {Short-rotation coppices (SRC) and alley cropping agroforestry systems
   (ACS) provide ecosystem services and environmental benefits.
   Particularly, their role in improving soil quality has frequently been
   emphasised. However, the economic lifetime of fast growing tree
   plantations may be limited, making a transition indispensable. Since
   information on effects of such land-use changes on soil microbial
   properties is scarce, the aim of this study was to assess effects of
   converting a German poplar-based SRC to a silvo-arable ACS, comprising
   rootstock incorporation and reduced tillage, on soil quality indicators
   after one year. Soils were sampled under poplars and within the
   re-converted alleyway. Distance transects were considered to further
   include potential beneficial effects of remaining trees on alleyway
   topsoil quality. We analysed soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen,
   soil microbial biomass C and N, ergosterol, microbial activity (enzyme
   activities, multi-substrate-induced respiration rates), ratios relative
   to SOC, fungal abundance and microbial functional diversity at two
   topsoil depths (0-5, 5-20 cm). Repeated measures mixed effects models
   were calculated for each depth, considering spatial dependence
   structures and potential heterogeneity of abiotic factors (pH, clay
   contents). SRC to ACS conversion decreased SOC, microbial biomass and
   activity in upper topsoils within the arable alleyway, irrespective of
   tree distance. Furthermore, shifts in the composition of main microbial
   groups towards a lower fungal abundance and functional diversity were
   observed. Reductions of fungal indices were also identified in lower
   topsoils. Unexpectedly, results demonstrated that partial conversion of
   a SRC back to arable cropping decreased soil quality within as little as
   one year.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Urban agriculture (UA) is regarded as an emerging tool and strategy for
   sustainable urban development as it addresses a wide array of
   environmental, economic and social objectives. Home gardening represents
   a common form of UA in the close living environments of urban dwellers
   that can be particularly important for rapidly growing cities and
   metropolitan regions in developing and transitional countries. However,
   a structured conceptual analysis of different urban sustainability
   benefits, including its operationalisation, is lacking. We therefore
   investigated whether and to which extent home gardening practices in
   urban residential environments contribute to urban sustainability. In
   detail, we analysed the contribution of prevailing cultivation
   practices, socio-economic situations, motivation, knowledge and
   networking of individual household and external framework conditions to
   the environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions of urban
   sustainability. Between January and May 2014, we conducted a
   questionnaire survey among 111 gardeners in residential neighbourhoods
   of Pune (India) and applied an analytical framework using composite
   indicators with index values to the compiled data. Our main results
   showed that sustainability benefits can be expected especially in
   environmental and socio-cultural aspects, particularly for urban
   biodiversity conservation and aesthetic green urban spaces, and less
   expected in economic contributions and food production. Gardening
   practice and sustainability contribution is rather determined by the
   motivation and socio-demographic factors of the gardener than type and
   size of the garden. We conclude that conserving and building home
   gardens can contribute to urban sustainability and should therefore be
   considered in the planning, design and management of urban spaces.},

Title = {How much information do we gain from multiple-year sampling in natural
   pond research?},
Journal = {LIMNOLOGICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Natural ponds are perceived as spatially and temporally highly variable
   ecosystems. This perception is in contrast to the often-applied sampling
   design with high spatial but low temporal replication. Based on a data
   set covering a period of six years and 20 permanently to periodically
   inundated ponds, we investigated whether this widely applied sampling
   design is sufficient to identify differences between single ponds or
   single years with regard to water quality and macrophyte community
   composition as measures of ecosystem integrity.
   In our study, the factor ``pond{''}, which describes differences between
   individual ponds, explained 56 \% and 63 \%, respectively, of the
   variance in water quality and macrophyte composition. In contrast, the
   factor ``year{''} that refers to changes between individual years,
   contributed less to understand the observed variability in water quality
   and macrophyte composition (10 \% and 7 \% respectively, of the variance
   explained). The low explanation of variance for ``year{''} and the low
   year-to-year correlation for the single water quality parameter or
   macrophyte coverage values, respectively, indicated high but
   non-consistent temporal variability affecting individual pond patterns.
   In general, the results largely supported the ability of the widely
   applied sampling strategy with about one sampling date per year to
   capture differences in water quality and macrophyte community
   composition between ponds. Hence, future research can be rest upon
   sampling designs that give more weight to the number of ponds than the
   number of years in dependence on the research question and the available
   resources. Nonetheless, pond research would miss a substantial amount of
   information (7 to 10 \% of the variance explained), when the sampling
   would generally be restricted to one year. Moreover, we expect that the
   importance of multiple-year sampling will likely increase in periods and

Abstract = {The interaction effects of different fertilisation regimes and weather
   variability on crop yield is a challenge that requires long-term
   investigation. Therefore, yield data for spring barley (SB) in an
   agricultural long-term field experiment, established in 1963 in
   Muncheberg, northeast Germany, were analysed to reveal the effects of 21
   fertiliser regimes and different weather conditions on SB yields. SB
   yields were significantly affected by fertilisation regimes (11\%),
   annual weather conditions (55\%) and their interaction effect (8\%).
   Mineral N fertilization decreased overall yield variability across
   seasons as compared to no fertilization and organic fertilization
   regimes showed higher yield variability. A suitable combined application
   of mineral nitrogen and organic fertiliser was found to be an effective
   way to produce higher SB yields than the application of either mineral
   nitrogen or organic fertiliser alone. A Bayesian linear regression model
   showed total precipitation during the growing season (April-July)
   positively affected on SB yields when high mineral N was supplied. At
   the early growth stage, a precipitation rate (March) and temperature
   (April or sowing day) negatively affected on SB yield.},

   Agricultural Experimental Field Plots Compared with Measurements},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Soil hydrological conditions influence crop growth and groundwater
   recharge and, thus, precise knowledge of such conditions at field scale
   is important for the investigation of agricultural systems. In our
   study, we analyzed soil hydrological conditions at three agricultural
   experimental field plots with sandy soils and different crop rotations
   using a 22-year period from 1993 to 2014 with daily volumetric soil
   water contents measured by the Time Domain Reflectometry with
   Intelligent MicroElements (TRIME)-method and pressure heads determined
   by automatic recording tensiometers. These measured data were compared
   with soil water contents and pressure heads simulated by a process-based
   agroecosystem model. Within this 22-year period, time spans with a
   better model performance and periods with a lower goodness of fit
   between simulations and observations were observed. The lower goodness
   of fit in the summer periods was attributed to inadequate calculations
   of root water uptake. Measurement errors of the TRIME-probes and
   differences between soil water contents measured by TRIME and pressure
   heads observed by tensiometers due to different measurement volumes,
   precision and measuring principles were identified as further reasons
   for mismatches between simulated and measured model outputs.},

Abstract = {The benefits of process-oriented modelling for management
   recommendations at the field scale are constrained by high spatial
   variability of soil properties and lack of dense information on soil
   types, variability and patterns. Geo-electrical mapping provides dense
   information about the soil, but sensor output is influenced by several
   factors. The agro-ecosystem model HERMES simulates nitrogen and water
   flow in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and was applied to 60 soil
   sampling points from a well-documented field with a wide range of soil
   texture in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Validation of HERMES
   resulted in satisfactory root mean square errors for yield
   (0.62tha(-1)), water (36.08mm) and nitrogen in the soil (74.93kgha(-1))
   over the whole simulation period of 3years. For the same field, values
   of electrical conductivity (ECa) ranged from 20 to 90 mS m(-1). Clay and
   sand contents of three soil layers were highly correlated with the
   measured ECa. Derived regression models showed R-2 values between 0.69
   and 0.85, and cross-validation of the statistical equations resulted in
   a very good reflection of observed soil texture for two of the three
   soil layers. The subsequent calculation of soil texture at the mapping
   points of ECa produced an improved resolution of this key attribute to
   initialize model simulation. The temporal and spatial patterns derived
   from this work linking the ECa sensor to a process model allow the
   designation of sub-areas within the field according to the soil nitrogen
   and water supply. However, results could be improved by considering more
   than one up-scaled soil property for process-modelling.},

Title = {The response of process-based agro-ecosystem models to within-field
   variability in site conditions},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Process-oriented agro-ecosystem models are increasingly applied to
   assess crop management options or impacts of climate change on
   agricultural production, food security and ecosystem services. Thereby,
   the aggregation of initial soil and climate information is a widely used
   approach for performing simulations at larger scales such as regions,
   nations or even globally. In this context, the ability of models to
   respond to different site conditions is essential for high quality
   impact assessment through the use of modelling tools. As part of a model
   inter-comparison the present study investigated models' yield response
   on variable site conditions using data sets from two well-documented
   fields, one located in Germany and one in Italy. The fields were sampled
   at 60 and 100 grid points, respectively, and soil and crop variables
   were recorded at varying intensity for the entire simulation period
   covering three growing seasons. The data was provided successively to
   the participating modelling groups in three calibration steps (a, b, and
   c) and the first growing season was considered for calibration. Model
   validation was based on these steps and each growing season as well as
   on the entire simulation period considering the soil state variables
   mineral nitrogen and water content (N, WC) as well as crop yield,
   biomass, and leaf area index (LAI). The WC was best depicted by the
   models, resulting in high correlation coefficients (r) up to 0.81
   between simulated and observed values. The root mean square error (RMSE)
   of simulated N ranged from 20 kg ha(-1) to 1072 kg ha(-1) regarding all
   steps and growing seasons. The annual within-field variability of yields
   was better simulated by the models when observed subsoil information was
   provided. However, the RMSE ranged from 0.5 t ha(-1) to 3.5 t ha(-1) at
   the German field, and from 0.6 t ha(-1) to 5.9 t ha(-1) at the Italian
   field, respectively. It was found that intensified calibration did not
   necessarily lead to improved model output. Furthermore, single models
   showed specific inconsistencies in their algorithms when, for example,
   underestimated WC was associated with overestimated yields. In total,
   the sensitivity of models to spatially variable site conditions differed
   considerably. The importance of quality-assured soil and yield
   information for model improvement was highlighted.},

   production risks. This study uses an ensemble of crop models applied on
   a spatial grid to quantify the contributions of various climatic drivers
   to past yield variability in grain maize and winter wheat of European
   cropping systems (1984-2009) and drivers of climate change impacts to
   2050. Results reveal that for the current genotypes and mix of irrigated
   and rainfed production, climate change would lead to yield losses for
   grain maize and gains for winter wheat. Across Europe, on average heat
   stress does not increase for either crop in rainfed systems, while
   drought stress intensifies for maize only. In low-yielding years,
   drought stress persists as the main driver of losses for both crops,
   with elevated CO2 offering no yield benefit in these years.},

Title = {Biogeochemistry of natural ponds in agricultural landscape: Lessons
   learned from modeling a kettle hole in Northeast Germany},

Abstract = {Kettle holes, small shallow ponds of glacial origin, represent hotspots
   for biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling. They abound in the young
   moraine landscape of Northeast Germany, potentially modulating element
   fluxes in a region where intensive agriculture prevails. The Rittgarten
   kettle hole, with semi-permanent hydroperiod and a surrounding reed
   belt, can be considered as a representative case study for such systems.
   Aiming to provide insights into the biogeochemical processes driving
   nutrient and primary producer dynamics in the Rittgarten kettle hole, we
   developed a mechanistic model that simulates the carbon, nitrogen,
   phosphorus and oxygen, phytoplankton, and free-floating macrophyte
   biomass dynamics. After model calibration and sensitivity analysis, our
   modeling exercise quantified the simulated nutrient fluxes associated
   with all the major biogeochemical processes considered by the model.
   Seasonality of nutrient concentrations, magnitude of primary
   productivity rates, and biogeochemical process characterization in the
   pond were reasonably reproduced by the model from July 2013 to July
   2014. Our results suggest that the establishment of a phytoplankton
   community well-adapted to low light availability, together with the
   differential use of N and P from free-floating macrophytes and
   phytoplankton can explain their coexistence in kettle holes. Sediment
   nutrient release along with decomposition of decaying submerged
   macrophyte are essential drivers of internal nutrient cycling in kettle
   holes. Our results also suggest that the Rittgarten kettle hole act as a
   net source of CO2 to the atmosphere on an annual scale, which offers a
   testable hypothesis for kettle holes with structural and functional
   similarities. We conclude by discussing the need to shed light on the
   effects of water level fluctuations on nutrient dynamics and biological
   succession patterns, as well as the relative importance of external
   sources and internal nutrient recycling mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {Detecting dominant changes in irregularly sampled multivariate water
   quality data sets},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Pages = {4401-4424},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Time series of groundwater and stream water quality often exhibit
   substantial temporal and spatial variability, whereas typical existing
   monitoring data sets, e.g. from environmental agencies, are usually
   characterized by relatively low sampling frequency and irregular
   sampling in space and/or time. This complicates the differentiation
   between anthropogenic influence and natural variability as well as the
   detection of changes in water quality which indicate changes in single
   drivers. We suggest the new term ``dominant changes{''} for changes in
   multivariate water quality data which concern (1) multiple variables,
   (2) multiple sites and (3) long-term patterns and present an exploratory
   framework for the detection of such dominant changes in data sets with
   irregular sampling in space and time. Firstly, a non-linear
   dimension-reduction technique was used to summarize the dominant
   spatiotemporal dynamics in the multivariate water quality data set in a
   few components. Those were used to derive hypotheses on the dominant
   drivers influencing water quality. Secondly, different sampling sites
   were compared with respect to median component values. Thirdly, time
   series of the components at single sites were analysed for long-term
   patterns. We tested the approach with a joint stream water and
   groundwater data set quality consisting of 1572 samples, each comprising
   sixteen variables, sampled with a spatially and temporally irregular
   sampling scheme at 29 sites in northeast Germany from 1998 to 2009. The
   first four components were interpreted as (1) an agriculturally induced
   enhancement of the natural background level of solute concentration, (2)
   a redox sequence from reducing conditions in deep groundwater to
   post-oxic conditions in shallow groundwater and oxic conditions in
   stream water, (3) a mixing ratio of deep and shallow groundwater to the
   streamflow and (4) sporadic events of slurry application in the
   agricultural practice. Dominant changes were observed for the first two
   components. The changing intensity of the first component was
   interpreted as response to the temporal variability of the thickness of
   the unsaturated zone. A steady increase in the second component at most
   stream water sites pointed towards progressing depletion of the
   denitrification capacity of the deep aquifer.},

Title = {Scales of Water Retention Dynamics Observed in Eroded Luvisols from an
   Arable Postglacial Soil Landscape},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil water retention is frequently described by unique main drying
   curves measured in the laboratory on intact soil cores. In the field,
   however, soil pore structure changes as a result of swelling and
   shrinkage, wetting and drying, or tillage operations. For
   erosion-affected arable soils characterized by truncated profiles, water
   retention dynamics could be even more complex. The objective of this
   study was to separate shorter term hysteretic from longer term seasonal
   dynamics in field-measured water retention data of eroded Luvisols. Soil
   water content and matric potential data were from tensiometers and
   time-domain reflectometry sensors of six lysimeter soil monoliths from
   two sites. For 2012 through 2014, drying and wetting periods were
   identified and fitted with the van Genuchten (VG) retention function.
   The results confirmed that drying water retention curves were steeper
   than those obtained in the laboratory. Steepness increased and fitted VG
   parameter values of saturated water content decreased within seasons,
   indicating that rewetting rates successively declined after each dry-wet
   cycle. Drying water retention curves returned to a similar level in each
   spring except for soils of transferred monoliths, where drying water
   retention tended to increase. Results suggested that water retention
   dynamics of eroded Luvisols was affected by continual incorporation of
   subsoil material in the Ap horizon and crop management practices in
   addition to hysteresis and seasonal dynamics. The disentangling of
   dry-wet cycles from time series of soil water content and matric
   potential was found useful for identifying the processes responsible for
   water retention dynamics and could eventually help improve flow and
   transport models.},

Title = {Water balance and leaching of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon of
   eroded Luvisols using high precision weighing lysimeters},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},

Pages = {144-160},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Erosion can be observed in many arable soil landscapes such as those of
   the hummocky ground moraine. The topsoil removal by water erosion in
   combination with tillage operations (e.g., ploughing) is leading to
   truncated soil profiles along slopes with reduced solum thickness and
   modified properties of soil horizons. The objectives were to identify
   and quantify effects of erosion-induced soil modifications on the water
   balance and the leaching of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC,
   DIC), considering complex soil-crop interactions. The idea was to
   compare lysimeter-based water and solute balances of eroded Luvisols
   that differed in solum depth. The six high precision weighing lysimeters
   (1.0 m(2) surface, 1.5 m high; UMS Science-Lysimeter) had a resolution
   of 10 g (=0.01 mm). The cylindrical steel rings of the lysimeters were
   filled with undisturbed soil monoliths from two fields. Lysimeter soils
   were cultivated with maize, winter rye, Sudangrass, triticale, alfalfa,
   and Persian clover during the observation period April 2011 to March
   2014. Cumulative drainage of the six lysimeter soils ranged from 57 for
   the least to 104 mm y(-1) for the most eroded Luvisols; the differences
   of about 83\% indicated that the erosional profile modifications in
   combination with differences in crop development affected the water
   balance components. Soil-crop interactions depending on properties of
   differently-truncated soil profiles caused varying amounts of
   precipitation and evapotranspiration for the 3-years. Since lysimeter
   effluent concentrations of DOC (5 +/- 0.5 mg L-1) and DIC (62 +/- 5
   mgL(-1)) were relatively constant in time, the DOC and DIC leaching was
   mainly controlled by the water fluxes. Thus, the leaching rates ranged
   from 0.3 (Luvisol) to 0.5 gm(-2) yr(-1) (eroded Luvisol) for DOC and 3.3
   (Luvisol) to 7.1 gm(-2) yr(-1) (eroded Luvisol) for DIC. Because of the
   complex soil crop interactions, a clear relation between erosion-induced
   soil profile modification and the water balance and DOC and DIC leaching
   could not be identified. Nevertheless, when transferring lysimeter
   results to the arable soil landscape the erosion-induced modifications
   even within the same pedogenetic soil type should be considered. (C)

Abstract = {The paper presents a database of hydrochemical and hydraulic groundwater
   measurements of a younger Pleistocene multilayered, unconfined/confined
   aquifer system in NE Germany. The Institute of Landscape Hydrology of
   the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) operates
   seven groundwater monitoring wells in the Quillow catchment located in
   the Uckermark region (federal state of Brandenburg, Germany). From July
   2000 to March 2014, water samples were collected periodically on
   different days of the year and at depths between 3 and 5m (shallow
   wells) and 16 and 24m (deeper wells) below the surface. The parameters
   pH value, redox potential, electric conductivity, water temperature,
   oxygen content, spectral absorption coefficient and concentration of
   hydrogen carbonate, ammonium, phosphate, chloride, bromide, nitrite,
   sulfate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcite, dissolved organic
   carbon, iron(II) and manganese were determined for each sample (doi:
   10.4228/ZALF.2000.266). The measurements, taken over a period of 14
   years, include a high variation of hydraulic situations represented by a
   corresponding database of 19 000 recorded groundwater heads. The
   hydraulic head was measured between 2000 and 2014 (doi:
   10.4228/ZALF.2000.272).},
